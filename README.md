This is a project where users can make their own account and submit secrets anonymously. I've built this project when I was learning about Authentication and Security.
I covered topics such as: Registering Users, Database Encryption, Environment Variables, Hashing and Salting passwords, using Passport.js to add Cookies and Sessions, OAuth 2.0 and Implementing Sing in With Google and Facebook.
